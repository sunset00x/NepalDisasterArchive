# Nepal Disaster Archive

Nepal Disaster Archive is a PHP and MySQL web application for documenting Nepal's natural-disaster history. It provides a public archive of published stories and an authenticated editorial workspace for managing stories, categories, and user accounts.

## Features

- Public archive of published disaster stories
- Search by title, location, year, summary, or content
- Filter stories by hazard category
- Story fields for dates, locations, impacts, casualties, magnitude, and sources
- Draft and published story states
- Featured stories on the public archive
- Admin/editor authentication with password hashing and CSRF protection
- Category management
- Admin-only user management and story deletion

## Requirements

- XAMPP with Apache and MySQL
- PHP 8.0 or later
- PHP extensions: PDO MySQL and mbstring
- A modern web browser

## Installation with XAMPP

1. Place this project in the XAMPP web root:

   ```text
   C:\xampp\htdocs\nepal-disaster-archive
   ```

2. Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.

3. Create the database by importing [`database/schema.sql`](database/schema.sql) in phpMyAdmin, or run it with the MySQL client. The script creates the `nepal_disaster_archive` database, tables, default categories, and a starter story.

4. Check the database settings in [`config/config.php`](config/config.php):

   ```php
   const DB_HOST = '127.0.0.1';
   const DB_NAME = 'nepal_disaster_archive';
   const DB_USER = 'root';
   const DB_PASS = '';
   const BASE_URL = '/nepal-disaster-archive';
   ```

   Update these values if your MySQL credentials or project folder differ.

5. Open the one-time administrator setup page:

   ```text
   http://localhost/nepal-disaster-archive/create-admin.php
   ```

6. Create the first administrator account, sign in, and then delete or rename `create-admin.php` from the server.

## Import starter stories in bulk

To add a curated starter dataset across all 13 default hazard categories, import [`database/seed-stories.sql`](database/seed-stories.sql) in phpMyAdmin after importing the main schema:

1. Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
2. Select the `nepal_disaster_archive` database.
3. Open the **Import** tab and choose `database/seed-stories.sql`.
4. Click **Import**.

The seed file is safe to run more than once because each story has a unique slug and uses `INSERT IGNORE`. It adds representative historical entries, not a complete record of every disaster in Nepal. Verify and expand the articles with authoritative sources before treating them as a definitive historical dataset.

## URLs

- Public archive: `http://localhost/nepal-disaster-archive/`
- Story page: `http://localhost/nepal-disaster-archive/story.php?slug=story-slug`
- Staff login: `http://localhost/nepal-disaster-archive/admin/login.php`
- Admin dashboard: `http://localhost/nepal-disaster-archive/admin/`

## Editorial workflow

1. Sign in through the staff login page.
2. Create a story from the dashboard or Stories page.
3. Assign a category and add verified historical sources.
4. Save the story as a draft while it is being reviewed.
5. Change the status to `PUBLISHED` when it is ready for the public archive.
6. Mark important stories as featured when appropriate.

Historical dates, casualty figures, and magnitudes may vary between sources. Add source notes and clearly communicate uncertainty where appropriate.

## Project structure

```text
.
├── index.php              Public archive and search
├── story.php              Public story detail page
├── create-admin.php       One-time administrator setup
├── admin/                 Authenticated editorial interface

├── database/schema.sql    Database schema and starter data
└── uploads/stories/       Story media upload directory
```

## Security notes

- Do not leave `create-admin.php` accessible after creating the first account.
- Use a strong database password outside a local development environment.
- Run the application behind HTTPS in production.
- Keep PHP, MySQL, and the web server updated.
- Back up the database and uploaded files regularly.
